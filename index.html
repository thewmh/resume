Multimedia Manager at Altium Ltd. Shanghai

May 2013 - November 2014

At Altium Ltd. Shanghai, being their Multimedia Manager, I was responsible for the company's Video Assets as well as Web Projects. From brief to storyboard or wireframe, I produced both Video and Web Projects from their inception through to their realization.

Producer / Designer at KinoCorp

October 2011 - May 2013

During my time at KinoCorp I was responsible for Video Production and Graphic Design.In the Video Production Department I had my hands in every step of the process, from Pre-Production to Post-Production. I was also an integral person when it came to Pitching and Managing Clients. Concept Proposals and Development, Logistics, Camera Assistant, Cameraman, Editor and Client Management were my main areas of focus. I also lead a number of interns through their internships while with us.
In the Design Department I was essentially the sole person responsible for creation and management of KinoCorp's Visual Assets. I also designed many of the presentations for Video Production Projects as well as redesigning their website before my departure.
